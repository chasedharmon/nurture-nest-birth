**Feedback:**

[Add notes here about the homepage - what looks good, what needs improvement]

Not certified lactation consultant - am certified breastfeeding specialist. Need to be careful with this verbiage throughout.

Not DONA certified yet, but will be soon - professionally trained Birth + Post Partum Doula, will have DONA certification soon, so we should save this for use later

these look like clickable buttons, but arent, is there a betteer way to display these? perhaps as badges? open to options

In services dection, dont like Postpartum Care verbiage, want it to say Postpartum Doula.

Same with Lactation Consulting - need different verbiage since im not a lactation consultant

Under comprehensive care for whole family - Car seat safety expert verbiage needs to change - should be either Car Seat Technition or Child Passenger Safety Technition (CPST)


Overall the home landingpage looks good and needs some minor verbiage tweaks. I also noticed that this page seems heavy, theres a lot of content here. We should look in to tightening things up.

Proudly serving Central Nebraska area - instead of 'in-home' maybe talk more about 'comprehensive'

Should investigate making website less focused on Central Nebraska Area - would be willing to travel if people are willing to pay

Want to make sure we use very inclusive language throughout

Will want to add real pictures at some point

```
I like this page for the most part, but wouldnt mind creating an 'about v2' page that would be moreso from the perspective of being a business with multiple doulas.

See other notes on my actual certifications and non-certificstiond. Need to be careful with this.

Again, note previous comments about possibly keeping location generic - im willing to travel

Will need to update the about page with 'real' content at some point

### 1.3 Services Overview Page

| **Rating**  | ☐ ✅ Good ☐ ⚠️ Needs Work ☐ ❌ Broken          |

**What to Look For:**

- [ ✅] All 6 services are listed:
  - Birth Doula
  - Postpartum Care
  - Lactation Consulting
  - Sibling Preparation
  - Car Seat Safety
  - Infant Massage
- [ ✅ ] Each service links to its detail page
- [ ⚠️] Descriptions are clear and helpful
- [ ✅] Layout looks professional

**Feedback:**

```
See notes on specific verbiage about consulting, certified, support, etc. Need to be careful and consistent throughout.

Dont love the vibe with mix and match. Birth Doula and Postpartum doula can stand alone. Lactation and Sibling prep have to be included with something else. Infant massage can be a standalone class. Carseat can request indivudal safety inspection. However, Infant massage+carseat tend to be included with doula.

Need to think harder about how to display this.

For example: infant massage doesnt make sense to include with birth doula for obvious reasons...but can be taught as part of postpartum doula.

Sibling prep - does includde emotional support

considering adding photography as a service since i am also a photogapher

- [ ✅] Call-to-action button works

**Feedback:**

```
Postpartum Care should be renamed Postpartum Doula Support throughout

On overnight support, it is not true that parents get garunteed sleep. Im not a babysitter. It's moreso for the peace of mind that baby has support while you are sleeping. Im questioning if i want to provide overnight support. keep for now, may rethink this.

What a daytime visit section looks like - hesitant on this because it is flexible and doesnt follow and certain schedule. varys based on needs of each family. Maybe phrase more like 'possible examples' of things that i can do or ways that i can help.

i like the postpartum mood change section, but should add info about the non-birthing parent. lots of stats about dads having mood disorders after baby born too

you dont have to do this alone - rephrase it and start with I'm here to help you family....' dont like the 'whether you need overnight...'

### 1.6 Lactation Consulting Service Page

- [ ✅] Call-to-action button works

**Feedback:**

```
Again, see notes on not using Consulting verbiage.

Teh truth about breastfeeding section - 24-48h sseems odd when the other things are percentage based. Display different, use other percentage styling that we have used throughout website.

Add on page to specifiy that if issues arrise, i will refer to certified IBCLC

Take out sections about tongue and lip ties and special situations. Not needed or true. Need to refere elsewhere, etc.

What to expect in consultation section - too rigid, dont like specific expectation, every situation is different. Can offer examples of common things

I am not going to push breastfeeding. I will support whatever decision is best for their family. Add info about paced pottle feeding, etc

HAve stats everywhere else, should add stats on benefits of human milk

dont want to provide writted summary of our visit

I'll meet you here youre at

in FAQ - need to take out info on insurance coverage. again, im not a certified consultant, I am a breastfeeding specialist. I can not submit my services to insurance

urgent/emergency - call medical provider, maybe reword. dont call me, im not a doctor. im moreso here for support.

### 1.7 Sibling Preparation Service Page

| Field       | Info                                                        |

**What to Look For:**

- [✅ ] Age-appropriate class description
- [ ✅ ] What kids will learn
- [ ✅ ] Session format (group, private, etc.)
- [✅ ] Call-to-action button works

**Feedback:**

```

Overall i like the sibling prep stuff, but Im not going to sign somebody up for services just to go talk with their kids. It's moreso helping parents navigate conversations before baby arrives and helping involved siblings afer baby arrives so they dont. feel left out. Again, this can not be a standalone package. It's just included with a doula service.

The explanation, information, and what we;ll expolore is all good though.

Session detail - same theme as others, needs to be flexible as its based on family need. offer common examples.

### 1.8 Car Seat Safety Service Page

| Field       | Info                                                           |

**What to Look For:**

- [ ✅] CPST certification mentioned
- [ ✅] What the service includes
- [ ⚠️] Types of car seats covered
- [ ✅ ] Call-to-action button works

**Feedback:**

```
Hard to navigate to car seat safety page, its not on the services page like the others. its only on the front home landing page. need to fix this.

home landing page has stats for 73% carseats installed incorrectly, carseats services page says 46% misued. Kind of confusing. I know these are different, but other folks may not. Use clear verbage and decriptions or consider changing the stats.

no mention of types of carseats covered, but thats OK. Dont need them.

Take out the pricing. Dont really want to do standalone, its just something that would be included with doula service. We do community carseat check days that we can post on blog or socialmedia or something if needed.

### 1.9 Infant Massage Service Page

take out the session options section and pricing entirely

### 1.10 Pricing Page

| Field       | Info                                          |

| **Rating**  | ☐ ✅ Good ☐ ⚠️ Needs Work ☐ ❌ Broken         |

**What to Look For:**

- [ ⚠️] Prices are clearly displayed
- [ ⚠️] Package details are easy to understand
- [ ⚠️] Payment options mentioned (payment plans, HSA/FSA)
- [ ⚠️] Easy to compare different packages
- [ ✅ ] Call-to-action buttons work

**Feedback:**

```
I like the page, but not convinced that we want to share pricing. And if we do share pricing, it shouldnt really be a range. The price is the price.

Also, lactation can not be a standalone.

Open to feedback. Feel like pricing you have listed is low. We should do serious research. Also dont want to scare people off or be disenginuous.

Dont really want to do mix and match packages

Its either birth doula or post partum doula, OR we could package bouth doula services together for a discounted rate

We should think hard about this. At the end of the day, i know what my time is worth and I dont want to give it away. Have mixed thoughts on payment plans as well. At the end of the day, I need to get paid quickly and efficiently. If people cant afford my services, then they are not my target clients anyways.

Should not require a deposit (becase its refundable),  but should require a retainer (because it is non-refundable). Lets look more in to retainers.

See some of the info I will provide in some of my extra documentation from a recent training that talks about pricing, retainers, etc, to help inform your decision.

Refunds are also a topic to explore. At the end of the day, i am blocking my tuime and giving up other potienitial clients. Feel like we need to be cautios and clear about how refunds will be handled. MAybe this is something more spelled out in a contact and doesnt need to be super blatant on the website.

Look in to best time periods to have balance due (like birth doula due by 36 week), postpartum is more ongoing, pay as you go?

Hesitate to have this many free resources.

I can see this page being valuable for SEO purposes

I will have these reouces in my portal for paying customers

We could keep things like carseat safety reference, postpartum prep guide, and hospital bag as free rources

lets think about how we really want to handle this page
