## Database Notes

### FK Relationship Disambiguation

When querying tables with multiple foreign keys to the same target table, use explicit FK names:

```typescript
// oncall_schedule has team_member_id and created_by both referencing team_members
team_member:team_members!oncall_schedule_team_member_id_fkey(...)

// client_assignments has team_member_id and assigned_by both referencing team_members
team_member:team_members!client_assignments_team_member_id_fkey(...)
```

### Enum Values

- `lead_status`: 'new', 'contacted', 'scheduled', 'client', 'lost' (NOT 'active')
- `activity_type`: 'note', 'email_sent', 'call', 'meeting', 'status_change', 'system', 'document', 'invoice', 'payment', 'contract', 'team_assigned'

## Turbopack HMR Bug

There's a known Turbopack caching issue causing phantom module references. Clear cache with:

```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
```

Also clear Playwright's browser cache if issues persist:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-*
```
